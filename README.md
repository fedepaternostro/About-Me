Hi! I’m Fede, a senior Biomedical Engineering student from Buenos Aires.

What I’ve done so far:

-Intern at the Innovation Unit of the Italian Hospital – I took part in several healthcare innovation projects.

- During my time there, we developed a low-cost medical device that protects patients during radiotherapy, taking it from idea → prototype → registered product.

- vibeastartup – Together with my team, we built an AI-powered viral video generator (using Veo 3) from social media trend scrapping.

- I’m always looking for new technologies and ways to build: lately, experimenting with vibecoding prototypes to explore how far I can go with this new way of creating.
